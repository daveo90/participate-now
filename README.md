### Are you a graphic / UI designer?

Get the design guidelines.

You can start designing your own theme for a wallet that a segmented wallet developer can then turn into a functional wallet. Remember you can profit from your design by adding a micro use license to it. To get the design guidelines please send us an email.

Become a segmented wallet developer.

If you are a mobile application developer in less than a week you can easily develop your own wallet without any crypto currency specific knowledge at all. Just spot a niche you would like to target with your wallet. The platform with its plug-ins will do all the heavy lifting for you. By adding a micro use license to your wallet you can profit from the time invested in developing it.

If you use an already existing UI package you will save yourself even more time and still your wallet will have a professional look and feel. As an additional advantage your wallet might be re-branded amplifying the reach of the micro use license you define.

Send us an email and we will help you with your wallet.

Become a Plug-in developer.

If you find that some functionality is missing write it as a plug-in and let all the wallets running on the platform use it. Remember that by adding a micro use license you can profit from your work when wallets or other plug-ins consume your service. Send us an email and we will help you develop your plug-in.

### Are you a project manager?

Help with the project management.

The project is challenging not only at the technical level but also when it comes to managing all the activities happening at the same time. If you would like to help organize and manage the project send us an email.

### Are you a retailer / brand?

Request your branded wallet.

If you are a retailer or a brand of any size soon you can have your own branded wallet enabling you to send coupons, vouchers, discounts, etc., to your wallets’ user base. All you need to do is send us an email.

### Are you a marketer / marketing agency?

Learn how to re-brand wallets for your customers.

If you are a marketer or a marketing agency and would like to learn how to re-brand wallets for your customers, send us an email. We might already have brands interested in having their branded wallets in which case we can give the task of re-branding to you.

### Do you have a crypto service running?

Integrate your crypto service into Fermat PIP as a plug-in.

In this way it will be accessible to all the wallets that run on top of it. Please note that by having a plug-in in the platform you can specify a use micro license thereby profiting from your service. In order to learn how to integrate it into the platform please send us an email.

### Are you from the press / media?

Write about us.

If you are from the media and would like to cover our story, please send us an email.

Do you already have a crypto wallet?

Write a version of your wallet for Fermat PIP.

There are several reasons to have a version of your existing wallet on the platform.

The main one would be that the business logic of your wallet would run as a platform plug-in, meaning that it can be reused by any of the segment specific wallets running on top of the platform. In the case of most of these wallets end users are unaware of the underlaying wallet engine used to manage their crypto currencies. It is a plug-in built for this purpose that decides on behalf of end users and if your engine is well reputed chances are that at least part of the end users’ funds will be managed by your wallet engine.

Segmented wallet developers can explicitly decide which wallet engine they use and thus you could have multiple segmented wallets using your wallet engine. Each segmented wallet could have different user interfaces and functionality. Those segmented wallets could be developed either by you or by third parties that appreciate and trust your brand and therefore choose to rely on your wallet engine instead of others.

A second good reason is that any segmented wallet that relies on your wallet engine can be re-branded by any marketer that would give it to brands, retailers, etc., thereby amplifying the reach of your technology.

Please get it contact with us to learn more about this by sending us an email.

### Are you a bank / financial institution?

Sign up for a pilot test.

By integrating Fermat into your systems you will extend the reach of your traditional products and services globally. In addition to that you will be able to offer new crypto products to your current customers.

You may wonder why you should use Fermat instead of developing your own wallet. The main reasons include:

* Multiple UI: Even if a stand alone crypto wallet could extend the reach of your products worldwide, it would still have only one set of functionality and one user interface. As opposed to that with Fermat PIP you can easily have dozens of different sets of functionality and user interfaces that fit every possible niche of the worldwide market.

* Freelance developers: You can have independent wallet developers adding even more niche wallet interfaces pointing to your wallet engine. (Provided that you and your regulators approve it.)

* Re-branding: Any of your wallets can be re-branded by retailers and local brands all over the world still using your wallet engine connected to your bank amplifying the reach of your products and services with little to no efforts. (Provided that you and your regulators approve it.)

Send us an email to learn more about this.

### Are you an event organizer?

Invite us to your event.

If you would like to invite us to present Fermat at your event we are more than happy to present our technology there. Please send us an email.
