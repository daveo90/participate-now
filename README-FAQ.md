# Fermat Frequently Asked Questions!

We have compiled the most frequently asked questions we were asked about Fermat. 

## What is Fermat?

Fermat is p2p Financial Application Framework. It as two main components:

* A p2p network for interconnecting devices between each other
* A framework for devoloping and running decentralized financial applications

It's main goal is to decentralize the full stack up to the user interface.

## What is the difference between Fermat and Counterparty?

* Counterparty is a protocol that adds some nice functionality on top of bitcoin implemented as a p2p network of nodes running this extended functionality. It also has a client software and an ecosystem of applications built on top of this infraestructure.

* Fermat p2p network doesn't have any financial functionality at all. I neither extends bitcoins functionality in any way. Its purpose is just to interconect devices to exchange any kind of meta-data.

* Fermat Framework doesn't have any financial functionality either. Its purpose is to host _Decentralized Financial Applications_ built with plug-ins. The framework provides access to any crypto network to allow apps to transport value, and to the Fermat network to transport meta-data.

* The Fermat Framework hosts a stack of _Platforms_ on top of it. Each platform adds layer after layer of functionality to the whole system.

So the answer to this question would be that the Architecture of Fermat and Counterparty is totally different. Fermat is higher on the stack and might have a plug-in to consume counterparty services and expose these services to other plug-ins within the Fermat Framework.

## What are the similarities between Fermat and Counterparty?

At counterparty you have a decentralized exchange, as well as the ability to create virtual assets, issue dividends, create price feeds and bets, and enables anyone to create smart contracts, all this at a protocol level and implemented on their p2p network.

Fermat might implement some of this functionality but running at a totally different level on the stack: at end user's devices. In some cases it might use a propietary implementation and in some others it might re-use Counterparty, Ethereum, Rootstock or other lower level service providers to do so.
